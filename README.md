# Base history used to make this game

**Daedalus History**

Daedalus is a prominent figure in Greek mythology, known for his exceptional skills as an inventor, architect, and craftsman. His name has become synonymous with ingenuity and creativity throughout history.

**Early Life and Royal Service:**
Daedalus was believed to have been born in Athens, and his lineage can be traced back to the royal family of Cecrops. From a young age, his brilliance in art and engineering became evident. He gained recognition for creating impressive sculptures and innovative designs.

**Exile to Crete:**
Despite his talents, Daedalus found himself in a tragic situation. Accused of a crime, he was forced to flee Athens to avoid punishment. Seeking refuge, he arrived in Crete, a land ruled by King Minos. There, Daedalus found favor with the king and began serving at the royal court.

**The Labyrinth and the Minotaur:**
One of Daedalus' most famous creations was the Labyrinth. King Minos commissioned him to construct an intricate and perplexing maze to imprison the fearsome Minotaurâ€”a half-human, half-bull creature born from the union of Minos' wife and a sacred bull. The Labyrinth was designed to be so complex that nobody who entered could find their way out without assistance.

**Aiding Theseus:**
During his time in Crete, Daedalus' life took a pivotal turn when he encountered Theseus, the young prince of Athens. Theseus had been sent to Crete as one of the sacrificial victims for the Minotaur. Recognizing Theseus' courage and determination, Daedalus offered him crucial advice on navigating the Labyrinth and defeating the Minotaur.

**The Flight of Icarus:**
One of the most tragic episodes in Daedalus' life involved his son, Icarus. Faced with imprisonment in Crete and seeking to escape, Daedalus crafted wings made of feathers and wax. He warned Icarus not to fly too close to the sun or the sea, as the wax would melt or the dampness would weigh down the wings. Overcome with excitement, Icarus ignored his father's caution and soared high into the sky. Tragically, the wax melted, and Icarus plummeted into the sea, where he drowned. Daedalus was heartbroken over the loss of his son.

**Later Life and Legacy:**
After the death of Icarus, Daedalus continued to travel and create masterpieces across different lands. He is credited with numerous inventions and architectural achievements, leaving a lasting legacy in the realms of art and engineering.
